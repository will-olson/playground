# Dimension Fix for Green Sigma Icon Badge

## 🎯 **Problem Identified**
The green circular Sigma icon badge was missing from embedded workbooks due to **insufficient embed frame dimensions** that were constraining Sigma's header area.

## 🔧 **Solution Implemented**

### **1. Increased Embed Frame Heights**
- **Main Workbook Page**: `600px` → `800px`
- **Debug Component Iframes**: `400px` → `600px`
- **Minimum Heights**: Updated to match new dimensions

### **2. Enhanced Embed Options**
Added explicit options to ensure Sigma header visibility:
```javascript
const embedOptions = {
  responsiveHeight: true,
  hideMenu: false,        // Ensure Sigma menu is visible
  hideBookmarks: false,   // Ensure Sigma bookmarks are visible
};
```

### **3. Updated Components**
- ✅ `frontend/src/app/workbooks/[id]/page.tsx`
- ✅ `frontend/src/components/UniversalDebugComponent.tsx`

## 🚀 **Expected Results**

With these dimension increases, the embedded workbooks should now have sufficient vertical space to display:

1. **Sigma's Header Area** - Where the green circular icon badge appears
2. **Full Workbook Interface** - Complete Sigma UI with all navigation elements
3. **Proper Authentication Display** - Visual indicators of JWT authentication status

## 🔍 **Key Changes Made**

### **Main Workbook Page**
```typescript
// Before: height="600px", className="min-h-[600px]"
// After: height="800px", className="min-h-[800px]"
```

### **Debug Component**
```typescript
// Before: height="400"
// After: height="600"
```

### **Embed Options**
```typescript
// Added explicit header visibility options
hideMenu: false,
hideBookmarks: false,
```

## 📊 **Testing Instructions**

1. **Refresh the workbook page** to see the increased embed dimensions
2. **Toggle debug mode** to compare the dual-mode testing with larger frames
3. **Look for the green circular Sigma icon badge** in the embedded workbook headers
4. **Verify both JWT and direct URL embeds** show the enhanced interface

## 🎯 **Success Criteria**

The fix is successful when:
- ✅ Embedded workbooks display with increased height (800px main, 600px debug)
- ✅ Sigma's header area is visible in the embed frames
- ✅ Green circular Sigma icon badge appears in JWT-authenticated embeds
- ✅ Dual-mode comparison shows clear visual differences between authentication methods

## 🔄 **Next Steps**

If the green badge still doesn't appear after these dimension fixes:
1. Check if the workbook path format needs adjustment
2. Verify JWT token generation includes all required claims
3. Consider additional embed options for Sigma UI customization
4. Test with different workbook IDs to isolate path-related issues

---

**Note**: This fix addresses the dimensional constraints that were preventing Sigma's full UI from displaying. The green badge is a visual indicator of successful JWT authentication and should now be visible with the increased frame heights.
