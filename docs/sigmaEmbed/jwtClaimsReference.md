JSON web token claims reference
When creating a secure embed, use these claims in the construction of the JWT to pass information in your embed URL.

ðŸš§
JWT claims are specific to a user, not a session. Do not use user-specific claims (such as teams, account type, or user attribute values) to manage what a user in a given session can view in an embed. Instead, manage access on the user level. Each user must have their own account to access the embed with the correct access level and permissions. Use consistent claim values for the same embed user across different secure embeds.
Refer to the following table of claims:

Claim name
