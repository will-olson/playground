Test an embed URL in the embed sandbox
Sigma's embed sandbox environment allows you to test your embed before integrating the content into the host application. View the content from the embed user's perspective to verify security settings and other configurations.

This document explains how to access and use the embed sandbox to develop and test your secure embed.

System and user requirements
Secure embedding must be enabled for your organization.
You must be assigned the Admin account type or have been granted embedding credentials by an admin. See Generate embed client credentials for more information.

In the workbook menu, select Embedding.

In the Embed workbook modal, select the appropriate tab:

Select JWT if you are using JSON Web Tokens to sign your secure embed. See Create an embed API with JSON Web Tokens.
Select Secure if you are not using JSON web tokens to sign your secure embed, or if you are using application embedding (deprecated).
Locate the content you want to test, then click Test to open the embed sandbox.
