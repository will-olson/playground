Common embed error codes and messages
When a secure embed encounters an error, an outbound workbook:error event is emitted. You can configure your host application to listen for the workbook error events emitted and display one or more custom error messages depending on the error code.

This document lists possible error codes that might be emitted from a secure embed which you can use to troubleshoot the root cause of an error and add custom handling to your host application code.

Session expired. Reload the page.

Session length has been exceeded.

To avoid this error, consider using a timer in your code to either display a refresh option or auto-refresh the embed for your users before the session length specified with the exp JWT claim is reached.

You don't have permission to access this page.

Invalid clientID, or other causes.

Validate that your client ID is passed to the embed correctly and is active.
