Embed URL parameters
When you create a secure embed, you can use URL query string parameters to customize additional functionality, in addition to what is provided by JWT claims for your secure embed.

The query string parameters listed in the available interface parameters table are supported for a JWT-signed URL.

ðŸ“˜
For details about URL parameters available for secure embed URLs secured with client credentials, see Add URL parameters to a secure embed.

You can also set control values using query string parameters, making sure that your secure embed loads with specific control values specified. See Set control values in a URL using query string parameters.

Usage notes
Query string parameters are applied at the end of a URL path. The first parameter follows a question mark (?) and additional parameters are added after an ampersand (&).

Values that you provide in the embed URL must be URL-encoded. For details, see URL encoding reference for parameters.

ðŸ“˜
If a parameter contains multiple values, do not encode the commas separating the values. In your URL, the value of your parameter should be passed to Sigma as value1,value2 rather than value1%2Cvalue2.
